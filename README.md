# Aeon Annual Home Survey

The Aeon Home Survey app is a full-stack web app that converts Aeonâ€™s offline home survey data of its properties and units into an online database, and stores that alongside survey input from Aeon residents to be exported for offline usage (or, as a stretch goal, viewed online). The main purpose of the web app is to allow Aeon staff to monitor completion of the home survey and support a door-to-door campaign by Aeon staff or volunteers to engage residents to complete the survey on a tablet-friendly view.

- [x] Site Manager Feature - The site manager would be able to log into a view where they would be able to see whether a survey for a unit has been completed, the unit is currently occupied, and if the resident has received their incentive for completing the survey.  The site manager would be able to update whether the resident has received the incentive.
- [x] Administrative Feature - The administrator would be able to add/delete/modify survey questions, add/delete/modify site managers, add/delete/modify properties.
- [x] Administrative Feature - The administrator view would include a display of the percentage of units who have completed surveys as a total across all properties.
